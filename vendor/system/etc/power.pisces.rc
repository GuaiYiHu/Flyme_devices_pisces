# NOTES:
#  The panelresolution is the lcd panel resolution.
#  No space should exist in panelresolution=[xres]X[yres].
#  panelresolution=720X1280 equals with panelresolution=1280X720.
#  For panelresolution=-1X-1, it should be the last set of power settings in this file.
#  When your panel resolution is found in this file,
#  it will use the set of power settings followed by your panel resolution.
#  When your panel resolution is not found in this file, it will use the default power settings.
#  The power settings followed by panelresolution=-1X-1 is the default power settings.
#  powernode is the sysfs or variable we need to write and it is followed by three ints.
#  normal, balanced, maxbatterylife are the three ints for different power modes.
